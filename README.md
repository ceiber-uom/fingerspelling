# wordlist.py

instructions to run: 

open anaconda prompt (anaconda3): 
`>> conda activate wordlist`
`>> cd Documents\Web-projects\wordlist`
`>> python wordlist.py`

This will create a server running the wordlist webpage on your local machine. 

To visit this webpage, on your local machine visit `127.0.0.1:8050` or on another device in the same wifi network visit `192.168.1.8:8050` and click away for random words! 

instructions to update wordlist:

There are two pre-computed wordlists containing words of length 4 - 8: 
`data\\vowel-pair.txt` and `data\\common-words.txt`

the wordlist was generated from https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english-no-swears.txt using `makelist.py`


This whole project (including documentation) took me about 3 hours
